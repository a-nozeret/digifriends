# Digifriends challenge
### Introduction given
Throughout this task, we talk of so called „Digifriends“ of a number X:
The Digifriends of X are generated by looping from  i = 1 to  i = X and taking numbers that satisfy the following conditions:
- If  i  is a multiple of 3, then the following number is one of X‘s Digifriends: i+i*X
- If  i  is a multiple of 5, then the following number is one of X‘s Digifriends: i + i * ROUND(SQRT(X)) + 1
- If  i is a multiple of 3  and also a multiple of 5, then the following number is one of X‘s Digifriends:
i + i * 3 * 5 * ROUND(SQRT(X)) + 2

The number of Digifriends of X is always smaller than or equal to X, so there is only a limited number of them.

### User Story
As a user, I want to insert a number so that its Digifriends are computed and saved in the database for later look up. The Digifriends for the number selected are then displayed.

## The app
![Demo](https://github.com/a-nozeret/digifriends/blob/master/demo.gif?raw=true)

### Tools and technologies used
**ReactJS** app styled with **SCSS** compiled with **npm scripts**. Backend and **API** written in **PHP** accessing a **MySQL** database with PDO.

### How to Run it
The source code is compiled and pushed to this repository (including CSS for easier use). Use the file **db_digifriends.sql** to build the database which configs must be:
    
    database name  = "digifriends"
    username = "root";
    password = "root";
    hostname = "localhost";
